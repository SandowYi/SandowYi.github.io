																	<p>Online sellers often face the hold-up problem that the platform may abuse its data advantage to compete against them in product market, 
																		thereby having lower incentives to invest in product innovation. </p>
																	<p>This paper explores the role of relational contract in solving such conflicts. 
																		In each period, a seller decides whether to remain on a platform and, if so, how much to invest in upgrading the product which will depreciate without continuous investment from the seller. 
																		Then, the platform decides whether to copy the seller's product. If the platform chooses to copy, both parties engage in competition; otherwise, they share the monopoly profit. 
																		A relational contract prescribes the seller’s decisions on separation and investment, and the platform's cooperation choice. 
																		We show that the efficiency of relational contract depends critically on the seller’s outside option and the product depreciation factor. Specifically, the outside option exhibits discontinuous and non-monotonic effects on efficiency, 
																		suggesting that higher outside option such as higher offline market value may not benefit sellers. </p>
																	<p>Moreover, the product depreciation factor can exert opposite effects on efficiency, depending on whether the platform will copy the seller off-path. 
																		Our model provides a useful framework for analyzing data-driven hold-up problems in the digital economy.</p>
